Changes in v1.6 -- leto
Sat Feb 16 09:46:51 EST 2002 
-------------------------
	* is_skew_symmetric() function added

Changes in v1.5 -- leto
Sat Jan 12 04:20:48 EST 2002 
-------------------------
	* t/inverse.t test 6 was numerically instable, commented out
		I ran it 10000 times and got values from 1e-2 to 1e-16,
		this caused the test to randomly fail, because it checked
		that the value was less than 1e-10
		I did not notice this problem because my default perl install
		has USE_LONG_DOUBLE
	* changed epsilon to be 1e-8 in funcs.pl ( was 1e-10)

	* new_from_rows and new_from_cols integrated from Math::MatrixReal::Ext1
	* is_diagonal() function added
	* is_tridiagonal() function added
	* each() function added
