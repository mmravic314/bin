Install
=======

1. Download MASTER source tar ball from http://www.grigoryanlab.org/master. 
   The downloaded file will be named master-vX.tar.gz, where X is version
   number. Unpack the file and move into the created directory:
  % tar -xzf master-vX.tar.gz
  $ cd master-vX

2 Obtain MSL library version 1.2.2.7 or later:

** EASY: download MSL as a statically compiled library:
  == for 64-bit Linux:
  % wget http://www.grigoryanlab.org/msl/msl-static-Linux-x86-64_1.2.2.7.tar.gz -O mslib.tgz
  % tar -xzf mslib.tgz

  == for MacOS (assuming you will be using gcc to compile MASTER):
  % wget http://www.grigoryanlab.org/msl/msl-static-MacOSX_1.2.2.7.tar.gz -O mslib.tgz
  % tar -xzf mslib.tgz

** HARDER: if you are using a different platform/architecture, or if the
   above failed, you will need to compile MSL from source. Here is how:
     % wget http://www.grigoryanlab.org/msl/msl-1.2.2.7.tar.gz -O mslib.tgz
     % tar -xzf mslib.tgz
     % cd mslib

     If you do not have the GNU Scientific Library installed on your machine,
     set environmental variable MSL_GSL to F to disable its use in MSL
     (MASTER's use of MSL does not rely on GSL routines). Do so with either
     "export MSL_GSL=F" for bash or "setenv MSL_GSL F" for csh/tcsh.

     Optionally, adjust Makefile to fit your system as needed. Then run:
     % make objects
     for speed, use the -j option to run on multiple cores. Following this, run:
     % ar rs libmsl.a objs/*.o
     % cd ../

3. Adjust any necessary flags/options for your compiler in makefile for
   MASTER (for Linux with g++, the default settings should work fine). For
   Mac, you may need to remove "-static" from LINKFLAGS.

4. Compile MASTER and support programs
  % make all

5. The following binaries are generated:
  * master - the MASTER search engine
  * createPDS - a tool for creating query and database structure files
  * extractPDB - given a match file from a MASTER run, this this tool
                 can be used to extract structures in PDB format (as one
                 or multiple files), sequences, etc.

6. Documentation.
  A quick set of instructions is included in README.
  For complete documentation, including a video tutorial,
  visit http://www.grigoryanlab.org/master/.

  Execution of programs without arguments prints usage information with 
  explanations of various options.
